      Improve your language skills with inspiring images & immediate feedback!
      <hr><br>
      Now that you've "climbed the mountain" of learning another language, keep your skills fresh with regular practice! Language output (speaking & writing) is key but can get dull with routine drills, plus you may never know if it's entirely correct. <br><span>ðŸ”¸</span><br> With ALPs, every writing challenge comes with an inspiring image to ignite your imagination, a random verb & grammar points to help focus your language, and immediate feedback with the help of AI!
